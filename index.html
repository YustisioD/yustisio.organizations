During my time in Paskabara, I gained many valuable experiences that shaped my character and discipline. In addition to learning about discipline, I was also taught teamwork, leadership, and how to overcome challenges in high-pressure situations. These experiences not only honed my physical skills but also strengthened my mental resilience, making me tougher and more confident. In Paskabara, I also met many friends who shared the same spirit, supporting one another to achieve common goals. Although I initially joined Paskabara due to my mothers insistence, over time, I realized how important this experience was in shaping me into a better person.</p>',

There were weekly training sessions that included learning Paskibra-related materials and marching practice. During that time, I participated in several competitions, such as the Gelora PBB Competition, Muhammadiyah Slawi PBB Competition, and a regional-level competition representing Tegal Regency, as well as Joint Training, and many more.</p>'

I initiated calling in coaches for competitions, although the results werenâ€™t optimal. I also initiated creating Paskibra uniforms as a form of branding. However, due to the pandemic, the order was delayed from 2020 until 2023.
